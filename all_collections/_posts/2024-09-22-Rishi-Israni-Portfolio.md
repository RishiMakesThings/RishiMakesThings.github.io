## About Me

I am a passionate **Computer Science** and **Biotechnology** student at the **University of New South Wales (UNSW)**. My unique combination of skills in technology and biology allows me to bridge the gap between disciplines, and I am excited by opportunities that let me solve complex, real-world challenges. I enjoy exploring how technology can push the boundaries of biology and medicine, aiming to develop innovative solutions through programming, research, and collaboration.
